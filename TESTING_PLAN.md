## ðŸ“Š Testing Notes

### General Guidelines
- **Test Ship (Dev)**: Use for quick access to all features
  - Max credits, max upgrades, no restrictions
  - Good for testing high-level content quickly

- **Standard Ship**: Use for realistic player experience
  - Tests progression systems
  - Validates economy balance
  - Better for full playthroughs

### Bug Reporting Template
When you find an issue, report:
```
Test ID: [e.g., HP-3]
Description: [What went wrong]
Steps to Reproduce: [Exact steps]
Expected: [What should happen]
Actual: [What actually happened]
Screenshots: [If applicable]
Console Errors: [Any errors in browser console]
```

### Performance Metrics to Watch
- **FPS**: Should maintain 60 FPS on modern hardware
- **Load times**: Docking/undocking should be instant
- **State updates**: UI should update immediately
- **Memory**: No memory leaks over extended play

### Known Limitations (Not Bugs)
1. **Timed effects processing**: Tracked but may not fully apply to economy yet
2. **Escort AI**: Basic pathfinding, doesn't defend itself
3. **Defender cleanup**: Hostile defenders don't despawn if reputation improves
4. **Closed stations**: Marked closed but may still be accessible
