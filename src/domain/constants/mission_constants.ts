"We have documented evidence of every infraction. This isn\'t punishment—it\'s consequence. Actions have weight in a functioning society."\n\nShe hands you the contracts one by one. "Deliver these to four major stations: Ceres Power Plant, Aurum Fabricator, Drydock, and Freeport. Standard Sol City enforcement terms: Greenfields produce will require inspection certification before trade. Additional tariffs apply to cover regulatory costs."\n\nYou can see the bigger picture forming. This isn\'t about safety anymore—if it ever was. This is about bringing Greenfields to heel. About making an example. About showing the entire system what happens when you challenge Sol City\'s authority.\n\nMira meets your eyes. "Some call this oppression. I call it civilization.

"This isn\'t competition—it\'s economic sabotage designed to destabilize energy prices system-wide. Chaos benefits no one."\n\nHe brings up financial projections. "Ceres Power Plant maintains grid stability for eight stations. Our energy reserves fund critical infrastructure—life support, agriculture, water recycling. If our operating costs spike due to artificially low fuel prices forcing us to sell at a loss, people die. It\'s that simple."\n\nThe projections show stations going dark. Systems failing. The calculus is cold but compelling.\n\n"Three convoys," Ivo continues. "Destroy them. Not to punish Rex—to prevent system-wide infrastructure collapse. I\'m offering premium compensation because this is critical." He meets your eyes. "I know how this looks. Monopolist hiring muscle to maintain control. But consider the alternative: Rex\'s naive idealism crashes fuel prices, Ceres Power Plant goes bankrupt, and eight stations lose their primary power supplier."\n\nHe transfers targeting data. "Sometimes the moral choice is the one that looks immoral from outside. Sometimes maintaining order requires actions that feel like oppression. Three convoys. Ten minutes."\n\nThe convoys are moving.

"Catalyst-grade compounds. With the right setup, Freeport could establish an independent micro-refinery. Not big enough to replace us, but big enough to break Ivo\'s monopoly permanently."\n\nHe pulls up refinery schematics—compact, efficient, distributed. "Forty units of rare minerals. That\'s the cost of freedom. Not just for fuel prices, but for the whole system. Proof that one station, one corporation, one person can\'t corner a market forever."\n\nKalla Rook\'s voice crackles over comms from Freeport: "We\'re ready on this end, Rex. Got engineers from three stations willing to help with setup. This has become bigger than business—it\'s a statement."\n\nRex looks at you with something approaching hope. "Forty units. Deliver them to Freeport. Help us build something that shifts the balance permanently. No more monopolies. No more manufactured scarcity. Just honest competition and fair prices."\n\nHe pauses at the viewport, watching the sun\'s glare off the refinery towers. "My granddad helped build this place.

"Market instability is creating opportunity. Every station is scrambling for fuel reserves. Panic buying. Hoarding.

This isn\'t just maintaining a monopoly—this is cementing it permanently.\n\n"You\'re wondering if this makes you complicit," Ivo observes. "If helping me corner the fuel market makes you part of the problem." He pulls up infrastructure dependency charts. "Consider: Ceres Power Plant hasn\'t had a grid failure in nine years. Not one.

Sol City hard-liners who want pirate blood. Pirate zealots who see negotiation as betrayal. People for whom the conflict has become identity, purpose, meaning.\n\n"Two waves of attacks," Kalla explains. "First wave will be Sol City loyalists trying to assassinate Vex and derail negotiations. Second wave will be pirate extremists trying to kill Mira for the same reason. Both sides want the war to continue because war is simple. Peace is complicated."\n\nInside the conference hall, you can see the participants beginning to arrive.

If workers walk off corporate stations, food supplies destabilize. Power grids strain. People suffer. I\'m offering premium compensation to anyone willing to deliver strikebreakers—skilled workers who will keep operations running. Save the system from Harlan\'s idealism."\n\nTwo philosophies. Two futures. Support the strike by refusing to trade with corporate stations for ten real-time minutes—watch prices spike, feel the economic pressure, prove labor has leverage. Or deliver strikebreakers to three corporate stations—keep the system running smoothly, protect people from disruption, break the strike before it begins.\n\nWill you stand with workers fighting for dignity, or with corporations fighting for stability?

    description: 'The strike worked. Corporate stations are scrambling, supply chains are strained, and even Dr. Elin Kade has agreed to come to the negotiating table. Kalla Rook at Freeport has volunteered to arbitrate—neutral ground, neutral party, binding agreement.\n\nChief Harlan greets you on Drydock with barely restrained triumph. "We did it," he says, voice rough with emotion. "Decades of getting squeezed, ignored, devalued—and we finally pushed back hard enough to be heard."\n\nBut the work isn\'t done. "I need economic data from six stations," Harlan continues, pulling up a list. "Real numbers. Operating costs, profit margins, labor expenses. Can\'t negotiate fair terms without understanding the full picture." He hands you encrypted data collection devices. "Gather the data. Bring it to Kalla at Freeport. Let\'s prove workers can win with facts and leverage, not just slogans and strikes."\n\nThe stations are waiting. The data is critical. The future of labor relations hangs in the balance.\n\nThis is what victory looks like—not glory, but logistics. Not slogans, but spreadsheets. The unglamorous work of actually changing systems.',

    description: 'The strike is broken. Workers have returned to their stations, and corporate operations have resumed normal capacity. But the tension remains—you can feel it in every docking bay, every fabrication floor, every refinery deck. This isn\'t over. It\'s just paused.\n\nDr. Elin Kade meets you in a secure conference room at Aurum Fab. "Chief Harlan is demanding arbitration," she says flatly. "Kalla Rook at Freeport has volunteered to mediate. Fine. We\'ll negotiate—but from a position of strength, not desperation."\n\nShe transfers data collection protocols to your system. "Six stations. Economic data. Operating costs, profit margins, labor expenses. I need the full picture before I sit across from Harlan and his union rhetoric." Her expression is clinical, but you detect something else underneath—maybe uncertainty, maybe respect for an opponent who actually made her sweat.\n\n"Bring the data to Freeport," Dr. Kade continues. "Let\'s see what \'fair terms\' actually look like when facts replace feelings. Maybe we find compromise. Maybe we prove unions are economically unsustainable. Either way, we negotiate with data, not emotion."\n\nThe stations are waiting. The data is critical. The future of corporate-labor relations hangs in the balance.\n\nThis is what victory looks like—not celebration, but homework. Not dominance, but preparation. The practical work of maintaining power.',
