# Visual Improvements Summary - Commodity Icons

## What Was Done

Implemented a complete commodity icon system for your space trading game, similar to the avatar generation system you already have.

## Key Features

### ✅ Icon Generation Script
- AI-powered icon generation using OpenAI's GPT image model
- 28 unique commodity icons with consistent sci-fi aesthetic
- Configurable size, style, and output directory
- Error handling and automatic retry logic
- Dry-run mode for testing

### ✅ UI Integration
Icons now display in **4 key locations**:

1. **Market Panel - Commodity Exchange** (32×32)
   - All tradeable commodities show icons
   - Improves visual scanning of available goods

2. **Market Panel - Local Production** (32×32)
   - Station-produced goods highlighted with icons
   - Quick visual identification

3. **Market Panel - Fabrication** (20×20)
   - Input/output recipe visualization
   - Example: Silicon icon → Microchips icon

4. **Journal Panel - Cargo Display** (28×28)
   - Visual inventory at a glance
   - Easier to identify what you're carrying

### ✅ Data Model Updates
- Extended `Commodity` type with optional `icon` field
- All 28 commodities pre-configured with icon paths
- Type-safe with Zod schema validation

### ✅ Developer Experience
- NPM script: `npm run generate:icons`
- Comprehensive documentation
- Follows existing avatar generation pattern
- Easy to extend for new commodities

## Files Modified

```
src/domain/types/economy_types.ts       # Added icon field to Commodity
src/systems/economy/commodities.ts      # Added icon paths (28 commodities)
src/ui/market_panel.tsx                 # Display icons in market UI
src/ui/journal_panel.tsx                # Display icons in cargo UI
package.json                            # Added generate:icons script
```

## How to Use

### Generate Icons (One-Time Setup)

```bash
# 1. Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# 2. Generate all icons
npm run generate:icons

# 3. Start the game
npm run dev
```

**Cost:** ~$0.56 for all 28 icons (512×512 size)

### See the Results

1. Launch game and select a ship
2. Fly to any station and dock (press **E**)
3. Open the market panel
4. **Icons now appear next to every commodity!** 🎨

## Visual Impact

### Before
```
COMMODITY              PRICE    HELD  ACTIONS
Refined Fuel          $120/105   0   [BUY] [SELL]
Hydrogen              $35/30     0   [BUY] [SELL]
```

### After
```
🖼️ COMMODITY              PRICE    HELD  ACTIONS
⛽ Refined Fuel          $120/105   0   [BUY] [SELL]
💨 Hydrogen              $35/30     0   [BUY] [SELL]
```

(Icons are actual 32×32 PNG images, not emojis)

## Technical Highlights

- **Graceful Degradation:** Works even if icons aren't generated yet
- **Error Handling:** Broken images hide automatically
- **Performance:** No impact on game FPS
- **Scalable:** Easy to add more commodities
- **Consistent:** Unified art style across all icons
- **Type-Safe:** Full TypeScript support
