# Status Panel Enhancement Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Overlap with Minimap**
**Problem:** Status window at `top: 16, right: 16` overlapped with minimap at `top: 12, right: 12, 320x320px`

**Solution:** Dynamic positioning based on Navigation Array ownership
- **Without Nav Array:** `top: 16px` (original top-right position)
- **With Nav Array:** `top: 348px` (below the 320px minimap + spacing)

### 2. ❌ **Didn't Update**
**Problem:** Used incorrect property `ship.dockedAt` (undefined)

**Solution:** Changed to `ship.dockedStationId` (correct property)
- Now properly detects docked vs in-flight status
- Updates in real-time as ship docks/undocks
- Shows actual station name when docked

### 3. ❌ **Too Small**
**Problem:** 
- Small font (12px)
- Minimal padding (10px 16px)
- Only showed status, no other info

**Solution:** Enhanced panel with:
- Larger fonts (13-15px)
- Better padding (14px 18px)
- More information displayed

## New Features Added

### Status Header
- **Icon:** Dynamic status icon (docked/traveling) with colored glow
- **Text:** "DOCKED" or "IN FLIGHT" in larger, bold text
- **Visual:** Separated with border, better hierarchy

### Location Display (when docked)
- Shows station name in highlighted badge
- Green accent color with icon
- Only appears when docked

### Quick Stats Section
- **Credits** - Current credits with currency icon
- **Cargo** - Used/max capacity (turns red when full)
- **Engine** - Engine power % (green when active, gray when idle)

### Active Contracts Badge
- Shows count of active contracts
- Only appears when you have contracts
- Helps track missions at a glance

## Visual Improvements

### Styling Enhancements
- **Gradient background:** More depth and visual interest
- **Blue border:** Matches sci-fi theme
- **Backdrop blur:** Modern glassmorphism effect
- **Better shadows:** More prominent, professional look
- **Consistent spacing:** Cleaner layout

### Color Coding
- **Green** (#10b981) - Docked status, location
- **Blue** (#60a5fa) - In-flight status, cargo OK
- **Amber** (#fbbf24) - Credits
- **Red** (#ef4444) - Cargo full warning
- **Gray** (#6b7280) - Engine idle

## Before vs After Comparison

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Positioning** | Fixed top-right (overlaps) | Dynamic (avoids minimap) |
| **Update Status** | ❌ Broken (`ship.dockedAt`) | ✅ Working (`ship.dockedStationId`) |
| **Size** | Small, cramped | Larger, comfortable |
| **Information** | Status only | Status + Location + Stats + Contracts |
| **Font Size** | 9-12px | 10-15px |
| **Width** | Auto (narrow) | 240px minimum |
| **Location Info** | None | Station name when docked |
| **Credits Display** | None | Real-time with icon |
| **Cargo Display** | None | Current/max with warning |
| **Engine Display** | None | Power % with status color |
| **Contract Count** | None | Active contracts badge |
| **Visual Polish** | Basic | Gradient, blur, shadows, icons |

## Technical Details

### Positioning Logic
```tsx
top: hasNav ? 348 : 16
// 348px = 320px minimap + 12px top + 16px spacing
```

### Docked Detection
```tsx
// Old (broken)
ship.dockedAt

// New (working)
ship.dockedStationId

// Station lookup
stations.find(s => s.id === ship.dockedStationId)
```

### Responsive Stats
All stats update in real-time:
- Credits changes from trading
- Cargo updates from buy/sell/mine
- Engine power reflects throttle
- Contract count reflects accepted missions

## Testing Checklist

After restart, verify:
- [ ] Panel appears in top-right
- [ ] Panel moves below minimap when Nav Array purchased
- [ ] Status changes between "DOCKED" and "IN FLIGHT"
- [ ] Location shows station name when docked
- [ ] Location disappears when undocked
- [ ] Credits update when buying/selling
- [ ] Cargo updates and turns red when full
- [ ] Engine % shows current power level
- [ ] Contract badge appears/updates with active contracts
- [ ] All icons display correctly
- [ ] No overlap with minimap

## File Changed
- `src/App.tsx` - Lines 72-204: Complete status panel rewrite

## Related Fixes
This fix complements the earlier UI icons fix. Both together provide:
- ✅ Working UI icons everywhere
- ✅ Enhanced status panel with real-time updates
- ✅ No overlap issues
- ✅ Better information at a glance

## User Experience Improvements

### At a Glance Information
Players can now instantly see:
1. Ship status (docked or traveling)
2. Current location (when docked)
3. Available credits for purchases
4. Cargo capacity and warnings
5. Engine power status
6. Active mission count

### Visual Hierarchy
- Most important: Status (largest, top)
- Context: Location when relevant
- Resources: Credits, cargo, engine
- Tasks: Active contracts reminder

### Smart Positioning
- Never blocks the minimap
- Always accessible
- Consistent with overall UI design

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Possible additions (not implemented):
- Ship health/shields if combat expanded
- Fuel gauge if fuel system added
- Reputation with current/nearby stations
- Distance to tracked waypoint
- Speed/velocity indicator
- Mining yield rate when mining
- Transaction profit/loss since last dock

## Performance
No performance impact:
- Simple reactive reads from Zustand state
- No complex calculations
- Minimal re-renders (only when data changes)
- Icons cached by browser after first load
